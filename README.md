# Python-Project
This python project is essentially a simple calculator for users to perform basic math functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplicaiton, division, as well as perform trig functions, sqaure roots, and factorials. We used the math library to import these functions into our little calculator. Our main struggle with this project was printing all of this informaiton when we ran it on thonny. Initally, our welcome message would only appear if one chose to quit runnining the program, whereas we wanted the welcome message to appear as soon as someone began to run the program. We changed the "break" function to "return" on line 68, which then gave us the welcome message when we began running the program like we wanted, and then it just gave us a goodbye message when we quit. Essentially, the welcome message gives you a list of operations to use, and then it asks oyu to iunput an operation. Then it asks to input a number for the variable x (and y depending on the operation) and it then performs the operation given on the input you gave for x, as long as it is a valid operaiton. If not, it will let you know it is invlaid.
